# Handling Layouts in Themes

- Composable API
- Import layout primitives for adding content
- Import pre-configured page layouts
  - How does content get populated?
    - Site Metadata/GraphQL
    - Theme config
    - Shadowing
    - None of these options are very "React-like"
- Styles should be completely customizable/easy to override
- Users will almost *always* have to override and change parts of the layout
- How do you provide component kits for things like landing pages?

```
themes/
  data-blog
  data-docs
  data-deck
  system/
    layout
      header
      footer
      sidebar
      container
```

A layout component like the one below could be what the end-user API looks like for a theme's layout.
The imported components could have default styles and handle styling of child content like links.

```jsx
// example custom layout
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Main,
  Container,
  Footer
} from 'theme-components'

export default props =>
  <Layout>
    <Header>
      <Link to='/'>Home</Link>
      <Link to='/blog'>Blog</Link>
      <Link to='/notes'>Notes</Link>
      <Link to='/about'>About</Link>
    </Header>
    <Main>
      <Container>
        {props.children}
      </Container>
    </Main>
    <Footer>
      Â© 2019
    </Footer>
  </Layout>
```

This is a very composable API, but what about a really zero-config solution?
