# Using Styled System with Reakit

[Reakit][] is a UI component library built with [Styled Components][].
You can extend the functionality of the components in Reakit with [Styled System][] to access values from the theme and add responsive styles.

## Demo

This demo extends the Reakit `Button` component with Styled System's `width` style function to give it a responsive `width` prop.
The button should be 100% width on narrow viewports and 50% width on larger viewports.

<Demo />

To create a responsive component like this, extend the `Button` component with the `styled` function from Styled Components.

```jsx
import { Button } from 'reakit'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { width } from 'styled-system'

export default styled(Button)(width)
```

You can add any number of Styled System style props to virtually any component.
