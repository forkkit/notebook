# Theme UI Context Composition

## Requirements

- Each theme can provide its own context
- Composed themes merge context when needed (when tho?)
- End-user can override *all* other contexts
- Should have a fool-proof API that hides the implementation details

## Example

- A site uses gatsby-theme-blog & gatsby-theme-notes
- Each theme has it's own theme context
- The site has it's own `src/theme.js` file that overrides some, not all, of the values
