# Theme UI Wrapper

- How should root-level styles be handled in theme-ui
- Use cases:
  - typography.js styles
  - base typography and color styles
- Where MDX wrapper falls short
  - non-MDX pages/content - anything in a React comonent will not have styles
  - MDX components with a custom wrapper or default export
  - Using a component for this explicit case is more intentional
- Should the default Layout component pick this up?
- Should there be a separate Typography component?
- Should the root styles be exposed so that *any* component can use these?
  - This could mean exposing the `themed` utility
- It could be an additional Styled component
- It could be merged with the provider component
- Possible component names:
  - Layout
  - Typography
  - Root
  - Styles
  - Base
  - BaseStyles
  - RootStyles
  - Styled.base
  - Styled.root
- Any styles coming from a theme should probably be scoped to a component
